This is a personal blog where I write about things that catch my interest (mostly tech research, experiments, and thoughts along the way).

I use it as a place to explore ideas, document things I'm learning, and occasionally think out loud about technology, infrastructure, and systems stuff that I find interesting.

Nothing here is meant to be authoritative. It's more of a living notebook than a finished manual :)
